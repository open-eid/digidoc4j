DigiDoc4J Java library release notes
------------------------------------
Release 3.0.0
------------------
Summary of the major changes since 2.1.1
------------------------------------------
* Refactor of jDigidoc into DDOC4J module. Only DDOC validation is now supported, all other functionality removed!
* PKCS11 slot selection with label
* Possibility to sign and validate detached XAdES signatures
* OCSP check for TM suitability
* Enabling LOTL validation constraints
* Bug fixes (incoclusive list):
- Fix for loosing configuration during serialization/deserialization
- Changes in DDOC error handling
- Support for old DDOC formats (1.0, 1.1)
- Fixes in digidoc4j utility

Known issues
------------
* PDF validation always returns invalid status
* Creating ASIC-S containers produces non standard containers
* AIA OCSP usage not supported

While upgrading, be sure that your integration :
* doesn't use Xalan or XercesImpl dependencies
* uses a patched Java version (JDK7u40+, JDK8 or higher)
Xalan and XercesImpl were used to patch XML vulnerabilities in older java versions. They should be discarded with higher versions because they override default Java XML security.
If it is not possible to remove Xalan, then you can set your system property to override TransformerFactory : System.setProperty("javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory","com.sun.org.apache.xalan.internal.xsltc.trax.TransformerFactoryImpl");

------------
Interoperability problems with jDigiDoc:
- OSCP certificate tag is missing RESPONDER_CERT id in signatures.xml file when BDOC is created with DigiDoc4j, but jDigiDoc requires that ID to be present. Note that RESPONDER_CERT id is not required by the BDOC standard.
- BDOC-TM (time-mark) files created with DigiDoc4j library can be validated with JDigiDoc version 3.10 or newer.


Release 0.2.18

New
---
It is possible to set TSL loading connection timeout
Signing certificate digest method is SHA256 instead SHA1
Generates random nonce for OCSP request for TS signature

-------------
Interoperability with JDigiDoc: BDOC-TM (time-mark) files created with DigiDoc4j library can be validated with JDigiDoc version 3.10 or newer.

Supports signing with ECC signature

Fixes
------
Signer's certificate validity now checked at OCSP response's produced at time

Known issues
------------
Interoperability with JDigiDoc: BDOC-TM (time-mark) files created with DigiDoc4j library can be validated with JDigiDoc version 3.10 or newer.


Release 0.2.16 
---------------------
- Support for handling ASiC-E XAdES (BDOC 2.1) digital signatures with time-stamps (denoted as LT level) and time-marks (denoted as LT-TM level).
- Support for handling DDOC (DIGIDOC-XML 1.3) digital signature formats. 
- Support for using TSL (Trust service Status Lists) for obtaining trust anchor information.
- Possibility to create signatures with PKCS#12 tokens and add signature values that are calculated in external systems. e.g. via browser plug-in. 
- Support for using RSA algorithm for cryptographic operations. ECDSA algorithm support will be added with the next iterations.
- ASiC-E LT-TM signatures (BDOC 2.1 with time-mark) that are created with DigiDoc4J library are not compatible with JDigiDoc library's versions 3.9 and earlier.
- Information about further developments can be found from Pivotal: https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1110130. The library's API may be changed in the course of future developments according to feedback from users.
