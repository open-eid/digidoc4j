DigiDoc4J Java library release notes
------------------------------------
Release 3.1.0
------------------
Summary of the major changes since 3.0.0
------------------------------------------
* Started to use DSS version 5.4 (sd-dss.5.4.d4j.1)
* AIA OCSP usage for ASIC-E containers
* Upgrade of dependencies
* Bug fixes (inconclusive list):
  - PDF validation fix
  - ASIC-S container creation fix
  - JAVA 7 support for truststore
  - TimeStamp url logging fix
  - Fixes in DD4J utility for PDF validation

Known issues
------------
* We have noticed a decrease in performance with new DSS 5.4 version. Performance test results can be found here.
* While upgrading from version older than 2.1.1 be sure that your integration :
  - doesn't use Xalan or XercesImpl dependencies
  - uses a patched Java version (JDK7u40+, JDK8 or higher)
    Xalan and XercesImpl were used to patch XML vulnerabilities in older java versions. They should be discarded with higher versions because they override default Java XML security.
    If it is not possible to remove Xalan, then you can set your system property to override TransformerFactory : System.setProperty("javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory","com.sun.org.apache.xalan.internal.xsltc.trax.TransformerFactoryImpl");

Release 3.0.0

Known issues
------------
* PDF validation always returns invalid status

While upgrading, be sure that your integration :

---------------------
- Support for handling ASiC-E XAdES (BDOC 2.1) digital signatures with time-stamps (denoted as LT level) and time-marks (denoted as LT-TM level).
- Support for handling DDOC (DIGIDOC-XML 1.3) digital signature formats. 
- Support for using TSL (Trust service Status Lists) for obtaining trust anchor information.
- Possibility to create signatures with PKCS#12 tokens and add signature values that are calculated in external systems. e.g. via browser plug-in. 
- Support for using RSA algorithm for cryptographic operations. ECDSA algorithm support will be added with the next iterations.
- ASiC-E LT-TM signatures (BDOC 2.1 with time-mark) that are created with DigiDoc4J library are not compatible with JDigiDoc library's versions 3.9 and earlier.
- Information about further developments can be found from Pivotal: https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1110130. The library's API may be changed in the course of future developments according to feedback from users.
