DigiDoc4J Java library release notes
------------------------------------

Release 5.3.1
------------------
Summary of the major changes since 5.3.0
------------------------------------------
* Updated DSS to 6.0.d4j.2 in order to fix memory leak issue in XAdESSignature
* Updated Bouncy Castle to 1.78.1

Release 5.3.0
------------------
Summary of the major changes since 5.2.0
------------------------------------------
* DSS version update to 6.0 (sd-dss.6.0.d4j.1), previously used DSS 5.11.1. Check changes in DSS here: https://github.com/esig/dss/releases
  DSS update has caused the following notable changes to dependencies:
  - Migration from Javax to Jakarta namespace
  - JAXB dependencies updated from 2.3.X to 3.0.X
  - Apache Santuario xmlsec updated from 2.3.X to 3.0.X
  - Bouncy Castle updated from jdk15on:1.70 to jdk18on:1.76
  - SLF4J updated from 1.7.X to 2.0.X
* Prefer to use AIA OCSP by default on signature creation
  - In DigiDoc4J command line utility, deprecated -aiaocsp parameter and added new -noaiaocsp parameter
* TEST mode default timestamp URL updated to http://tsa.demo.sk.ee/tsa
* Changes in validation policies
* Updated dependencies

Known issues
------------
* EDIT 10.06.2024: NB! Underlying DSS library version used in this release has memory leak since DSS 5.13.RC1.
* At the time of release, the newest supported Bouncy Castle version is 1.76
  Bouncy Castle version 1.77 causes OCSP response parsing to fail
* We have noticed a slight increase in TSL loading times due to pivot LOTL support
* We have noticed a decrease in performance with the introduction of properly accessing AIA certificate resources
* Opening a container that contains signatures, triggers TSL loading (TSL lazy loading does not work as expected)

Release 5.2.0
------------------
Summary of the major changes since 5.1.0
------------------------------------------
* Disabled the possibility to create signatures with LT_TM and B_EPES profiles
* Fixed OCSP request nonce encoding (in CommonOCSPSource) on signature creation - OCSP nonce, used in
  "id-pkix-ocsp-nonce" OCSP extension, is now a DER-encoded OCTET STRING, which is encapsulated as another OCTET STRING
  (see https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4366.html#section-3.6 and https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6961.html#section-2.2)
* Deprecated "full report" configuration flag, as enabling it can produce false negative validation results in some cases:
  - Deprecated setFullReportNeeded and isFullReport needed methods in Configuration class
  - Deprecated -err/-showerrors command line option in DigiDoc4J command line utility
* Updated dependencies

Known issues
------------
* We have noticed a slight increase in TSL loading times due to pivot LOTL support
* We have noticed a decrease in performance with the introduction of properly accessing AIA certificate resources
* Opening a container that contains signatures, triggers TSL loading (TSL lazy loading does not work as expected)
* While upgrading from versions older than 2.1.1 be sure that your integration :
  - doesn't use Xalan or XercesImpl dependencies
  - uses a patched Java version (JDK8 or higher)
    Xalan and XercesImpl were used to patch XML vulnerabilities in older java versions. They should be discarded with higher versions because they override default Java XML security.
    If it is not possible to remove Xalan, then you can set your system property to override TransformerFactory : System.setProperty("javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory","com.sun.org.apache.xalan.internal.xsltc.trax.TransformerFactoryImpl");

Release 5.1.0
------------------
Summary of the major changes since 5.0.0
------------------------------------------
* DSS version update to 5.11.1 (sd-dss.5.11.1.d4j.1), previously used DSS 5.9. Check changes in DSS here: https://github.com/esig/dss/releases
  - identification of timemark signatures was improved in DSS
* The functionality to add timestamp tokens to ASiC-S containers was deprecated and will be removed in the future
* Added default TLS configuration for outbound connections in default "digidoc4j.yaml" and "digidoc-test.yaml" files
  - default TLS protocol: TLSv1.3
  - supported protocols: TLSv1.2 ja TLSv1.3
  - configured a set of enabled TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 cipher suites
* Improved META-INF/manifest.xml file creation for ASiC containers
  - the manifest tag in newly create ASiC containers now has a version attribute with value "1.2"
* Deprecated input parsing constructors of ASiC container classes - it is encouraged to use ContainerOpener and ContainerBuilder instead
* API improvements:
  - added possibility to configure custom AIA sources (via AIA source factories)
  - deprecated possibility to configure AIA data loaders (via AIA data loader factories)
* Dependencies update

------------------------------------------
* Required minimum Java version increased to 8

    Xalan and XercesImpl were used to patch XML vulnerabilities in older java versions. They should be discarded with higher versions because they override default Java XML security.
    If it is not possible to remove Xalan, then you can set your system property to override TransformerFactory : System.setProperty("javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory","com.sun.org.apache.xalan.internal.xsltc.trax.TransformerFactoryImpl");

------------
Interoperability problems with jDigiDoc:
- OSCP certificate tag is missing RESPONDER_CERT id in signatures.xml file when BDOC is created with DigiDoc4j, but jDigiDoc requires that ID to be present. Note that RESPONDER_CERT id is not required by the BDOC standard.
- BDOC-TM (time-mark) files created with DigiDoc4j library can be validated with JDigiDoc version 3.10 or newer.


Release 0.2.18
---------------
New
---
It is possible to set TSL loading connection timeout
Signing certificate digest method is SHA256 instead SHA1
Generates random nonce for OCSP request for TS signature

-------------
Interoperability with JDigiDoc: BDOC-TM (time-mark) files created with DigiDoc4j library can be validated with JDigiDoc version 3.10 or newer.

----
Verifies that the signature contains one signed properties reference
Supports signing with ECC signature

Fixes
------
Signer's certificate validity now checked at OCSP response's produced at time
Revoked certificate now returns correct error message

Known issues
------------
Interoperability with JDigiDoc: BDOC-TM (time-mark) files created with DigiDoc4j library can be validated with JDigiDoc version 3.10 or newer.


Release 0.2.16 
---------------------
- Support for handling ASiC-E XAdES (BDOC 2.1) digital signatures with time-stamps (denoted as LT level) and time-marks (denoted as LT-TM level).
- Support for handling DDOC (DIGIDOC-XML 1.3) digital signature formats. 
- Support for using TSL (Trust service Status Lists) for obtaining trust anchor information.
- Possibility to create signatures with PKCS#12 tokens and add signature values that are calculated in external systems. e.g. via browser plug-in. 
- Support for using RSA algorithm for cryptographic operations. ECDSA algorithm support will be added with the next iterations.
- ASiC-E LT-TM signatures (BDOC 2.1 with time-mark) that are created with DigiDoc4J library are not compatible with JDigiDoc library's versions 3.9 and earlier.
- Information about further developments can be found from Pivotal: https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1110130. The library's API may be changed in the course of future developments according to feedback from users.
