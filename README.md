# DigiDoc4j
DigiDoc4j is a Java library for digitally signing documents and creating digital signature containers of signed documents.

# Features
* Creating BDOC, ASiC-E and DDOC containers
* Digitally signing containers in XAdES format
* Validating BDOC, ASiC-E and DDOC containers

# How to use it
* Take a look at the [examples](https://github.com/open-eid/digidoc4j/wiki/Examples-of-using-it)
* See the full [DigiDoc4j API](http://open-eid.github.io/digidoc4j/) description
* Explore the [Wiki](https://github.com/open-eid/digidoc4j/wiki) section
* Download the latest [release](https://github.com/open-eid/digidoc4j/releases)
* See the [library development guide](https://github.com/open-eid/digidoc4j/wiki/Development). Your contribution and pull requests are more than welcome

# BDOC (ASiC-E) container format
* Has **.bdoc** or **.asice** extension
* BDOC is a new digital signature format developed in 2014 to replace the old, DDOC (DigiDoc) digital signature format. 
* The benefits of the new format include the higher security level, the long-term integrity of the signed documents, as well as the better compliance with international standards.
* BDOC container is based on **ASiC-E** standard.
* Signatures are stored in **XAdES** format.
* Supports two signature formats: **BDOC-TM** and **BDOC-TS**
* **BDOC-TM** signature format has **time-mark** ensuring long-term provability of the authenticity of the signature.
 * This format has been used as a default digital signature format in Estonia since 2015.
 * It is based on **XAdES baseline LT** signature format.
 * Recommended extension is **.bdoc**
* **BDOC-TS** signature format has **time-stamp**.
 * In contrast to the BDOC-TM format, long-term provability of the authenticity of the signature is ensured by time-stamps.
 * It is based on **XAdES baseline LT** signature format and uses RFC3161 based time-stamps which makes it highly compliant in international context.
 * To ensure better compliance with international standards, it's recommended to sign documents with the **BDOC-TS time-stamp** signature profile.
 * Recommended extension is **.asice**
* **.bdoc** or **.asice** file is in fact a ZIP container with the signed files, the signatures and the protocol control information and can basically be opened by any program that recognizes the ZIP format.

# DDOC container format
* Has **.ddoc** extension
* An old DigiDoc digital signature format
* Since year 2015 it's recommended not to sign documents in the DDOC format
* It is based on XML Advanced Electronic Signatures (**XAdES**) format, corresponding to  profile XAdES-X-L
* The DigiDoc container includes the source files (the files that were signed) as well as the signatures that are related to the signed file(s)
* Every signature contains the certificate, validity confirmation and the validity confirmation service certificate.
